# Roadmap

Planned work lives here as one markdown file per item (a **puck**), each with YAML
frontmatter (`title`, `status`, `updated`, optional `tags` / `issue` / `order`)
and a free-form body for goal, research and open questions. Status flows
`inbox → now / next / later → done`.

- **One puck = one file:** `roadmap/<slug>.md` (or `roadmap/<slug>/README.md`
  when it needs attachments). The slug is the stable ID — don't rename casually.
- **Starting a puck:** set `status: now`, link the `issue:`, bump `updated`.
- **Shipped:** set `status: done` and write a `## Delivered` section. Keep the
  file as history.
- **New undecided ideas:** put them in `inbox`.

The truth is these plain files — readable in an editor, greppable by an agent, and
harvested by the multi-repo roadmap board.
